I create using ChatGPT in only 2 hours dynamic website login page and from which you can fill you all details and can upload resume 

If you want to use this code on you loacl PC follow this steps

1 - install XAMPP server 

it's very easy download XAMPP and click as install on your laptop or pc their no need to change XAMPP during installation press ok ok ok ok done
After installation you can see xampp folder in C:/ drive

2 - Your my-website folder structure looks like this:

Create all files inside my-website follow this path if javascript code you have than you can create script.js otherwise you can skip

C:\xampp\htdocs\my-website\
<br>
├── index.html
<br>
├── style.css
<br>
├── script.js
<br>
└── process.php

3 - if you using chatgpt to create PHP, HTML and CSS, code you need to change path which you set for post action in index.html which is PHP path of localhost
but in my code no need to change anything
